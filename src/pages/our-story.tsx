      motherhood, and it was the beginning of her journey. She turned her kitchen into an
      experimental space while her children slept. Each failed attempt at the perfect entremet wasn't a
      setback; it was a step forward on the path to mastery. Chef Zareen came to India from the
      illustrious London kitchens with more than simply a set of baking techniques; she brought a
      vision for connecting cultures. As she taught Kannu the intricate techniques of French pastries,
      she would often comment, "Every layer tells a story," as her hands would gracefully glide
      through the air. "The base speaks of foundation, the Crémeux of passion, and the glaze—that
      final, perfect mirror—reflects not just light but the journey of transformation."

      offering takes matters to the next level. Consider a base of nutty pecan sponge, with warmth

      tonka bean perfume that whispers behind the powerful tones of our house-roasted coffee mix.
      Finally, a concluding drizzle of pecan praline seeps out with each bite, providing a molten
      contrast to the light pastry. This isn't fusion for fusion's sake; it's respect for both traditions
      creating something entirely new. French technique meets Indian spice, tropical bean meets
      roasted nut - an orchestra of tastes that widens culinary boundaries. And it all starts out with
      respect. Respect for the centuries-long mastered croissant. Gratitude for the butter chicken
      recipe carried down through the centuries. Respect for the farmers who farm our sustainable

          <OurStoryCard span={24} lg={12} xl={12} xxl={12} img={blogImage.src} title={`A Dream's Beginnings`} desc={`Dreams simmered like sweet caramel for Kannupriya Garg during the quiet hours of
                  motherhood, and it was the beginning of her journey. She turned her kitchen into an
                  experimental space while her children slept. Each failed attempt at the perfect entremet wasn't a
                  setback; it was a step forward on the path to mastery. Chef Zareen came to India from the
                  illustrious London kitchens with more than simply a set of baking techniques; she brought a
                  vision for connecting cultures. As she taught Kannu the intricate techniques of French pastries,
                  she would often comment, "Every layer tells a story," as her hands would gracefully glide
                  through the air. "The base speaks of foundation, the Crémeux of passion, and the glaze—that
                  final, perfect mirror—reflects not just light but the journey of transformation.`} />
